I finally moved my personal site to Hugo.  After much consideration, I decided not to migrate any of my old blog posts.
Much of the information is outdated, and even though I have some content that was linked to from StackOverflow, I don't feel
if was current enough to warrant keeping the information.


I also enjoy the idea of starting new.  A clean slate to embrace my own personal transistions from the engineer I was to the engineer
I can be.

So here is to a bright new future for my own career, and my online presence.
